Final Coursework: Build an eLearning app
Introduction During   the   course   so   far,   we   have   developed   several   applications   using   Django.   This   has   covered single page applications, database schemas, appropriate model design, forms   and   templates,   RESTful   webservices,   Celery,   Django   Channels,   Web   Sockets, Authentication   and many   other topics.
For this assignment you are tasked with developing an   eLearning application   using   all   knowledge you   have gained on the course   so far.
This assignment   is worth 50% of the total mark for this   module.
Task 
To   implement the eLearning web application. The   minimum application requirements   are:
Your application should allow users to create   new   password   secured   accounts.
You should   have two different types of users   i.e. students   and   teachers.   Note:   each   type   should   have different   permissions e.g. a teacher can   have access to   several   student records,   but this   is   not a   possible for a student account.
You   should   collect   and   store   an   appropriate   amount   of   information   about   each   user   (e.g.   username, real   name,   photo etc.).
Each   user should   have a “home”   page that shows their user   information   and   any   other   interesting data such as   registered courses,   upcoming deadlines, etc.   It   should   also display   user status updates. These   home   pages should   be discoverable and visible to   other   users.
Students should   be able to   post status   updates to their “home”   page.
Students should also   be able to leave feedback for   a   particular   course.
Teachers should   be able to search for students and other   teachers.
Teachers should create the courses and upload   course   material   –   images,   pdfs,   etc.
Teachers should view their courses and see a   list   of students   enrolled   on their   course.
Students should see a list of available   courses   and   select the   courses   they   want   to   enrol   to.
Additionally,   users should   be able to   use   a   portion of the application that   makes   use   of   real   time communication   by   using web sockets. Some examples   may be   real-time text   chat, shared whiteboard between students and teachers etc. Other functionality   could   also utilise audio streaming and file transfers. You are free to   use web sockets   as   you   wish   but   you   must   include   1 web sockets app   in your application. 
An appropriate   REST interface for User data should   be   provided.
The application should   include functionality that   makes appropriate   use of Web Sockets.
You are free to design the application layout   as   you wish.   Each   functional   module   (student   list, courses, search   results, etc...)   may   be a separate   page or you   may   choose   to   make the application a Single   Page   Application.
Deliverables D1.   A   django   application   that    implements    an   eLearning   web   application   and   fulfils   the   functional requirements.   The   Application    should    include some users (i.e. students    and   teachers) for demonstration purposes.D2. A report   (4000-6000 words)   describing the   application   and the   reasoning for   its   design   and   functionality.   The   report   should   explain   how   your   application   meets   the   requirements   (see below for criteria R1-R5). Explain the logic of   your approach, why is your code arranged   as   it   is?   Explain   the   design   of   your   application,   covering   all   design   and   implementation   decisions you   have   made. The end of the   report   should   critically   evaluate   your   application.   Discuss your design and implementation, did it   work   well?   what parts of   the application could   be   better?   What   would   you   change   if you   attempted   the   project   again? This   report   should   also   include a   brief section on   how to   run the   unit tests.   Finally   include   a   section   on   how   to   unzip,   install requirements and run   your   application:
• A list of all packages and the versions   used for your   implementation.
•         Your development environment   i.e. the operating system and   python version
•          Instruction for logging into the django-admin site   i.e.   username and   password
•          Login credentials for teacher and students
•          Include   how to   run the   unit testsD3: 代 写CM3035 - Advanced Web DevelopmentPython
代做程序编程语言  Include   a   video   of   your   web   application   showing   and   verbally   highlighting   the   main   functionalities and your achievements. You can   upload   the   video   in   .mp4   format   or   use   the   alternative   link – see submission   page. Your video should show how you:
•          install the app using   the   requirements.txt
•         talk about the database design and   normalisation
•         test the app   by   running the tests
•          launch the app and logging in – showing e.g.   feedback   status   updates   for   a   course
•          launch redis server   and in a second browser to login the second user to initiate a chat   between students or a student   and teacher.
This   should   not   be   longer   than   10   minutes.   We   recommend   that   you   capture   the   video   in   mp4 format using software such   as   OBS.
D4.   Bonus points will be given to those who deploy their app   using   AWS,   Digital   ocean,   etc.   You should supply details   in your report   i.e. app   address   and   login   details.

Code   style   and   technique 
Your code should be written according to the following   style   and technique   guidelines:
C1: Code   is clearly organised   into appropriate files   (i.e. view   code   is   placed   in   an appropriate view.py or api.py file,   models are   placed   in an appropriate   models.py   file)
C2:   Appropriate comments are   included to ensure the code   is clear   and   readable
C3: Code   is   laid out clearly with consistent   indenting,   ideally following   python   pep8   standard
C4: Code   is organised   into appropriate functions with clear,   limited   purpose
C5:   Functions, classes and variables   have   meaningful   names, with   a consistent   naming   style.
C6:   Appropriate tests to cover the   API functionality are provided.
Submission 
You   should   write   a   brief   report,   record   a   video   demo   and   submit   your   source   code.   The   submission should contain the following items and   information:
S1:   Deliverables   D1 compressed   in standard   .ZIP format.
S2:   Deliverables   D2 and   D4   in   .PDF format.

S4:   Deliverable   D3   -   alternative   link –   use   of YouTube   or similar and submit   the   link. Make sure your video remains unlisted. 
Marking Criteria The   application will   be   graded   on whether   it   is   technically   correct   and   implements   the API   as   requested.   Code   should   be   clear   and   easy   to   follow.   The   application   should   be   well   organised - for instance - it   should make correct use of models,   API, view and serialiser files.   A good application will include a suite of tests that ensure that application correctly   implements the   API that   is described.
